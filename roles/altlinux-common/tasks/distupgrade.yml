# XXX: apt exits before trigger have completed. Thus trigger processes
# will be killed as soon as ssh connection terminates. Use systemd-run
# to avoid the problem.
# Note: ignoring the exit code might seem wrong (and it is wrong). However
# that's the exit code of the last exited process (presumably delayed
# filetriggers) rather than the exit code of `apt-get` itself. A regular
# `apt-get install rpm` does the very same thing: it arranges filtetrigger(s)
# to be run after apt-get has exited, so there's no check filetrigger(s) exit
# code. Moreover a zero exit code of apt-get does not guarantee the update
# was OK.
